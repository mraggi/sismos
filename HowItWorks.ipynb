    "Suppose you had a set of points $P=\\{p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_n\\}$ on the plane, but for which you didn't know the coordinates. You only know the relative pairwise euclidean distances, and only approximately. That is, for points $p_i, p_j \\in P$, we know an approximation $d_{ij} \\approx d(p_i,p_j)$, where $d$ denotes the euclidean distance. How do we construct $P$? This is useful in earthquake analysis, apparently.\n",

    "## Problem statement\n",
    "Given a symmetric matrix $D \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$, produce a set of $n$ points in 2d-space for which the pairwise euclidean distance matrix matches $D$ as \"closely\" as possible, where the definition of \"closely\" might mean euclidean distance (in $\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}$) or even L1-distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly an optimization problem: For every set of points $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 2}$, find the pairwise distance matrix $D_P$, where $D_P[i,j] = d(p_i,p_j)$. Among all such $P$, find the ones that minimize $d(D_P, D)$. If $L_1$ distance is desired, then minimize $\\sum |D_P-D|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many methods that can and do find a good minimum. Even simple gradient descent often manages to find a good solution. However, experimentally, we found the best results using differential evolution [1]. This optimization method, in a nutshell, maintains a population of individual candidate solutions that gradually improve, by attempting to combine each with three others (chosen randomly). In this sense, differential evolution can be thought of as a genetic algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, given $P, A, B, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times 2}$, produce $$P' = A + \\lambda(B-C)$$ where $\\lambda$ is a real number. Then, for each coordinate, choose either $p_i$ or $p_i'$ randomly to form a new element $\\tilde{P}$. If the objective function turns out to be better for $\\tilde{P}$ than it was for $P$, replace $P$ by $\\tilde{P}$ in the next generation.\n",
